# Daily-Average-Temperature-Brazilian-Stations
This repository contains a .mat file ("Temperature_Celsius.mat") with the daily average temperatures registered by 100 Brazilian weather stations from 12/25/2001 through 12/21/2012. The data were collected by the Brazilian National Institute of Meteorology (Instituto Nacional de Meteorologia - INMET) and retrieved from https://portal.inmet.gov.br/. Within the .mat file, there is a 100-by-4015 matrix variable (also named "Temperature_Celsius"). Each line of this matrix corresponds to a different weather station, and the first column of this matrix contains the ID of each station. The remaining columns show the daily average temperature measured in Celsius at each day from 12/25/2001 to 12/21/2012. Furthermore, this repository contains a .xlsx file  (Stations_Coordinates.xlsx) with the name and lattitude and longitude coordinates of each station represented in the .mat file.
